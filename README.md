# Yelp Restaurant Reviews: Sentiment Analysis and Topic Modeling

The project analyzed Yelp reviews of California restaurants using advanced text analytics techniques, including text preprocessing, NLTK’s Sentiment Intensity Analyzer, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modeling, and linear regression to predict ratings based on sentiment scores. It processed 168,000 reviews from 588 restaurants by tokenizing, normalizing, and stemming text, removing irrelevant characters and stop words.

The LDA model achieved maximum coherence at 18 topics, which were grouped and hand-labeled into four meaningful categories, with ‘service’ emerging as the predominant topic (42%) and, along with ‘food’, showing the highest correlation with star ratings.


Recommendations: Implementing a “Yelp Rating Breakdown” and “Summary of Review” feature to provide detailed insights into specific aspects of ratings, helping restaurants improve their services, strategic marketing, and competitive edges and customers make informed decisions, personalized choices, and trend identification in restaurant performance over time. Overall, this feature benefits:

- Improved User Experience: Both businesses and customers benefit from more organized, accessible information.
- Increased Platform Value: These features could make Yelp more valuable and user-friendly, potentially increasing user engagement and retention.
- Data Transparency: Provides a clearer, more nuanced picture of customer sentiment beyond just an overall star rating.
